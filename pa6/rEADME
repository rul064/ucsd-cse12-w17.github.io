1.The first example is I filter out all the n-grams words that with a punctuation with it because an n-gram span across sentences or across comma boundaries does not generate a useful sequences, and we needn't to analyze and consider it. All of the circumstances can be filtered out by this filtering rule.
The second example is to convert all the words to lower case to make case insensitive. 
2.The run time should be O(nlog(n)). It takes 10806ms to load all the sample data.  
The outter loop runtime is O(n). The inner loop is O(log(n)).


3.
The runtime of querying the dataset is nlog(n).
 it takes 825ms for sample series "is a".
